Based on the analysis, here are the recommended actions:

1. Add null checks to all user.level access:
   Change: user.level
   To: user?.level || 0

2. Conditionally render user-dependent components:
   {isAuthenticated && <UserProfileModal />}

3. Check these specific files (most likely sources):
src/components/User/UserProfile.jsx
src/components/User/UserProfileModal.jsx
